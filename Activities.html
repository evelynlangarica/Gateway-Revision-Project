            Sazon!!! Need I say more? Dominican Republic is home to some of the best food in the world. It would be a
            crime to travel here and not try some of their staples: tres golpes, sancocho, mangu, tostones,pastelon,etc.
            I recommend going to street vendors for the traditional antojitos (snacks) or any inexpensive restuarant the
            plaza has to offer. If you are on the boujee side,there are plenty of upscale restaurants you can visit that
            will satisfy your palette with authentic and fusion cuisine.
